# CapstoneProject
My Phase Five Capstone Project, The Spooky Sorter

# Pitch
My project will consist of an application that can sort horror based movies into more digestible content for lay people. My idea is to have a drop down where users can pick a subgenre of horror (supernatural, slasher, pyshocological, etc) and from there, be able to choose, based on a sliding scale for gore, from there, a list of potential movies will be listed. The idea is to get people who would normally never be interested in this genre, to feel comfortable dipping their toes into the water with something they know won't be too offended by.

# User Stories
As a user, you will be able to: 

Choose a subgenre of horror 

Pick on a sliding scale which level of gore you are comfortable with (0-5) and then a list of movies will be presented.

 # Goals
Divide movies (I think I am probably just do 15-20 of my favorites) into subgenres


List movies with their run time.


Class each movie on the basis of gore. (These are all going to be arbitrary and based on my personal grade, but Iâ€™ll try to keep things objective)


Build a sorter (based in react) that can decide movies based on a genre/ their horror rating

# Strech Goals

Toggle d#ad dog on/off (does a dog d#e on screen)
	
Where to watch each movie (JustWatch is one of my favorite websites/app on the planet, so I would love to give them an homage)
